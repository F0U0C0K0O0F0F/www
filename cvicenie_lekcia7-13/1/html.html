        <h1>HTML language</h1>
        <p>The HTML language is essential knowledge that you need to have in order to create websites. It's pretty simple and all websites use it. Advanced websites use a few more languages along with HTML.</p>
        <h2>Editor</h2>
        <p>It's not a good idea to use a regular Notepad to write HTML code since they lack a lot of necessary features like code highlighting and UTF encoding support.</p>
        <h3>Notepad++</h3>
        <p>As you are a beginner and will only be making basic webpages, for now, I recommend using Notepad++ (an advanced text editor).</p>

        <h2>HTML page</h2>
        <p>An HTML page is a very simple thing to create. Essentially, all it is, is a text document.</p>

        <h3>Tags</h3>
        <p>HTML consists of marks (aka tags). HTML's main purpose is to give meaning to specific parts of the document. At first, HTML was also used for graphic styling which resulted in confusing websites and has been limited to editing web content.</p>

        <h4>Doctype</h4>
        <p>HTML files have a specific structure that they have to follow. The first thing we have to add is the doctype at the very beginning of the file.</p>

        <h4>HTML</h4>
        <p>The entire document is placed inside the HTML element. This element is then split up into 2 more: head and body.</p>
